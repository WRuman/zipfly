# Zipfly
Simple utility with a small memory footprint for creating zip files

## Building
Once you have a working Go compilation environment, simply use `go install`

## Usage
Run `zipfly {filename}` where filename is the path of the file you want to zip.
Once the file has been zipped up successfully, *the original will be deleted*.

## Background
Zipfly was originally a learning tool to help us get comfortable with some 
golang concepts. There's lots of room for improvements and extra features, so
feel free to fork this project and contribute!
